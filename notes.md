## NOTES

On completion, these are my notes

### Issues

- The most important issue I encountered being context of the challenge. I was lacking an extensive context and spent most of the time allocated researching the problem
- Also, the grenache library kept throwing an error that was difficult to trace. image attached below

- Typescript. I thrive utilizing typescript and it was difficult due to the grenache library not supporting typescript. I was able to evade this using javascript objects

### Remainder

What do I feel is left in this project?
<br/><br/>

Well, if I am given enough time to finish an extensive research and perfect the orderbook and allow for connection with the client and server.

Thank you
